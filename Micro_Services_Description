* My preffered architecture for complex web applications is Micro-service architecture.
* Microservice architecture consists of a collection of small, autonomous services. 
* Each service is a separate codebase, which can be managed by a small development team implementing a single business capability.
* Each micro-service handles its own data in a separate database.
* Services communicate with each other by using APIs. Internal implementation details of each service are hidden from other services.
* Any client intending to call the micro-services, should call the API gateway which will then call the micro services.
